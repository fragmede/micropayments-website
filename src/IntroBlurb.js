      <h2>Alright, Internet, you want micropayments?</h2>
      <p>This is how it could work.</p>
      <p>Follow this eight step guide, and give me 10 cents.</p>
      <p>Our step-by-step guide will walk you through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🏦 Setting up a digital account to handle your funds</li>
        <li>💰 Getting a small amount of digital currency</li>
        <li>👛 Creating a secure digital wallet</li>
        <li>🔌 Connecting your wallet to our website</li>
        <li>💸 Making your first small online payment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This guide gives one way of doing things, there are other ways to do it, but this is one way it could work! It needs a lot more polish, and work before becoming mainstream, but the rails are here. We could actually make it happen.</p>
